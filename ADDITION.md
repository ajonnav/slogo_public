# Estimation: before looking at the old code:

## how long do you think it will take you to complete this new feature? how many files will you need to add or update? Why?

I think that I will take an hour. I need to make more command classes, add to UIConstants property file and add to DisplayModel.java.

# Review: after completing the feature:

## How long did it take you to complete this new feature? how many files did you need to add or update? Why? did you get it completely right on the first try?

It took me about an hour and a hlaf. I needed to update the files I said I needed to update as well as English.properties, TurtleModel.java. I did not get it right the first time.

# Analysis: what do you feel this exercise reveals about your project's design and documentation? was it as good (or bad) as you remembered? what could be improved?
what would it have been like if you were not familiar with the code at all?

I think that our code was written very well. It took me a minimal amount of time to get this feature implemented. However, I could not figure out how to complemtely implement the problem with the lines running over the boundaries. That seems to be more of a front end roblem than a backend problem.
