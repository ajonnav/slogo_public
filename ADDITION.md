#### Estimation

I think it will take about an hour to complete the new feature. I think I'll only need to update three files, two new commands (for window and fence, of course) and the turtle model. I believe that I simply have to alter how position is changed and change the show and pen statuses accordingly. 

#### Review

It took me roughly two hours to complete the new features. I had to update a total of 9 classes, but only 4 of them had significant code changes. The other 5 were either properties files, constant classes, or fixing some bugs that I found remaining from the original project. I The 4 significant classes were the two commands, a helper class to process display behavior, and the turtle model. I did not get it completely right on the first time, struggling with getting the turtle to appear/disappear correctly as well as the pen to go up and down correctly. 

#### Analysis

The project's design and documentation is still relatively good - I knew exactly what to do from the beginning and even the files to change, but I had trouble with the implementation itself. This, however, was not due to the design of the project but rather just a difficult feature to implement. The TurtleModel class can definitely be improved by using objects to hold the properties instead of simply primitives. However, the design of the project allowed this new feature to be added in only a few classes, which shows its strength. If I were not familiar with the code at all, it would not have been too difficult either, considering I only changed a few classes.
